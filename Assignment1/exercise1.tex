{\bf \Huge Exercise 1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf OLTP:} Stands for 'Online transaction processing' and are a series of short online transactions. OLTP is mainly used when you want to achieve fast query processing.\\
	{\bf OLAP:} Stands for 'Online analytical processing' and has a low volume of transactions but more complex queries which means that it requires fewer queries to do the same operation. 

	\item A {\bf datacube} is an multidimensional array which have three or more dimensions and contains multiple set of data.\\A {\bf cuboid} is a subcube or a cube formed set of data. It might refere to a set of data and a result from a query.

	\item Operations you can do on a cube is slice, dice, rollup and drill-down.\\
	{\bf Slice:} Here you select a part of the cube, often removing a side of the cube, too analyse it.\\
	{\bf Dice:} Here you split the datacube into multiple smaller datacubes.\\
	{\bf Rollup:} In this operation you put together slices of data to create a new cube.\\
	{\bf Drill-down:} This operation takes out a portion in the cubes middle part, often a dice or just a single value.\\
